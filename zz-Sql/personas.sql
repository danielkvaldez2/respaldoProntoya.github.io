But at these levels, value has been created. \" It refers to figures like these: 16.2 percent in dollar bonds maturing in three years or better still, 17.8 percent in bonds that mature in two. At a time when the benchmark Treasury bonds of the United States have a yield of 2.5 percent and those of other more stable emerging markets like Chile only 4 percent, these are attractive figures, especially in a country that received a historic loan of US $ 56,000 million from the International Monetary Fund, is reducing its fiscal deficit and even registers a trade surplus. \"I would be very reluctant to leave Argentina completely,\" Paul McNamara, GAM\'s investment director in London, who oversees some US $ 135 billion, said in an interview. \"The currency is cheap and unlike what happened last year they have a large external trade surplus.\" Of course, there are many things to worry about. One of them is the country\'s history of non-compliance. He did not pay bond investors for 15 years until they finally reached an agreement in 2016, months after Mauricio Macri took office. The peso lost more than half of its value last year and is on track to repeat as the world\'s worst performing currency in 2019. And perhaps the most relevant is the threat that Macri will not achieve re-election in October and lose out to his populist predecessor, Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner. The concern for his return to power after the polls showed that he surpasses Macri motivated the collapse this week. In the absence of six months for the elections, the popularity of Macri has been affected since the economy is going through the second recession in his government with inflation that is above 50 percent, which led the Executive to announce controls on prices that in the opinion of analysts are signs of panic. But Jaime Duran Barba, who has accompanied Macri throughout his political career, says that investors exaggerated. Focus now on the surveys, he says, \"is absurd.\" Volatility is typical of emerging markets, said Jan Dehn, head of London-based research at Ashmore Group, which manages about $ 85 billion. \"If you\'re afraid of market volatility, you should not be in this business,\" Dehn shot. \"Volatility is a permanent feature in emerging markets, but we know that permanent losses are small in comparison. Volatility is, in almost every case, absolutely your best friend. \" In addition, there is a good chance that inflation will go down from now on, creating a window of opportunity as support for Macri rebounds, according to Whitney Baker, founder of the New Yorker Totem Macro, which advises funds that have more than US dollars. $ 3 billion. Local investors are also looking for offers.

First, because Brazil was never a country that only saw or interacted with developing nations. And on the other hand, when they arrived at the government they realized that Mercosur has a very great relevance, and the relationship with Argentina is quite important. In any case, although they are beginning to see reality, there is still a discourse that Brazil was very isolated and that it would have to try to reach broader agreements with more developed countries. The idea that Brazil has to try to close an agreement with the European Union (EU), Canada and Korea as priorities for this year is stronger. On the other hand, it insists that Brazil has to open more to the world and make a reduction in tariffs. In this line there is an expectation of the Bolsonaro government that when Brazil occupies the presidency of Mercosur, in the second half of this year, some reforms of the bloc or the Mercosur decision mechanism will be proposed. That is what is in the head of the government of Bolsonaro especially to advance more with international agreements and the negotiation of tariffs. Cut yourself -It includes in these Mercosur reforms the fact that countries can sign agreements independently and that negotiations are not necessarily en bloc? - According to the government, they will try to continue with a Mercosur negotiation policy as a bloc, but if the bloc does not advance, the alternative would be to change the rule that does not allow to seal agreements of its own. - Beyond the interminable negotiation with the EU (the contacts began in 1994), in the last time the Mercosur resumed its agenda with other countries and blocks. What changed to believe that concrete advances can be registered this time? -In the negotiation mechanisms, offers have been on the table since last year.

For all this I prepared myself with the best in their subjects and take note, I asked, I asked, I took it to scale, I even studied the probabilities of each of my hypotheses. This led me to a conclusion that the recruitment of information was important, relevant and with a potential for improvement. That\'s why I started working on how an Intelligent Port would be, I called it ... without knowing that there were already people who had established this terminology and even work methodology. Finally, through a book that many people helped me complete, I proposed the change with reliable statistical data and previously checked studies that provided accurate data on how to carry them out, development costs and estimated profits. To that I added the presentation of the book in several provinces and conferences to which I was invited .. all in pursuit of the growth of the Port that saw me being born and was practically managed by people with the motor and intellectual capacity of a kindergarten child of the smallest room (without pretending to offend the sweet children with so much desire to learn to the contrary of these infamous public workers armored in their posts without having even been communicated because they occupy it). In each site that I visited, I was enriched both in knowledge and a walk back through the university. It was great!!. From there a new world before me, of offers for the WORLD that demanded from our COUNTRIES, so many products. Visit more than 100 productive sites to choose 40, 40 products that are useful for those who touch our Ports. Doing a study in conjunction with a sociologist about MIGRATIONS in our COUNTRY and its crops, Experts in Ports (of the most important in the WORLD), elite engineers in each sector and economists with extensive knowledge in each of the areas to be developed , with enough experience in them. All this gave us an expertiz on the field of Foreign Trade A vital point for growth. \"KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO SELL TO THOSE WHO KNOW THAT THEY VISIT US\". That\'s why after working with professionals in the area and bringing together industry leaders to boost growth, we find this cluster of inoperantes without a compass. What neither dumb nor lazy took the most superfluous idea and tried to do something .. something is the propitious knowledge that corresponds to the question. They were so incompetent and careless that they did not ask for help and took the risk of doing it as the old saying \"tie it with wire\" says. This happened in the place that before this study were thinking of entering boats of 12 meters in length or making a city in the port with all the inclemencies against it especially environmental ... but more important shortening what we promoted with the growth of SMART PORT that we offered. To all this in record time in 140 years of stagnation, they moved that unknown muscle called gluteus so that in 15 days with my idea they do something similar to the mamarracho that I was painting a work of art. Without more ... I leave with me cognitive synthesis about the sad way of stealing an idea. This synthesis is accompanied by a painting made by @ marianoh22o what shows all the lamebotas that Goliath had in the village hanging from a mate (his inseparable friend), trying to eat from above like the giraffes. Between hope and utopia .. I prefer HOPE because it is not a minor difference: utopia is prefabricated, it is a model of instructions, while HOPE is a territory to be built. Therefore, it requires the meeting of wills who still do not know what they propose and what they must do to get out of a world dominated by FINANCE, a political class that empties the language of meaning, together with a group of paid applauds like a Mexican sitcom full of comfortable and common places. I keep waiting for those QUESTIONS wisely guided (by trained people that do not exist), to find possible paths to that HOPE that can take the WORLD out of the DEMEMORITY and the FALSE MESSAGES of the ALWAYS explorers.', 'aprojects-news-902.jpg', 0, '2020-01-24 21:47:46'),
(23, 20, 'December', ' TRADENEWS', 'THE 10 LARGEST CONTAINER PORTS IN THE WORLD', '  Each day, millions of cargo freight travel from one port to another, connecting people and businesses around the world. We usually take their work for granted, but we are not fully aware of how much work they really have to handle. So we decided to present the world\'s top 10 container ports based on the volume they handle. International logistics is one of the most important industries in the world. He is in charge of moving all the goods in the world so that people can have access to everything they need and want. Around 90% of global trade is carried out through maritime shipments, in which large volumes are handled. Thus, while international trade continues to grow, ports have no choice but to grow and work on their efficiency to meet demand. The volume of commercial exchange will continue to increase, that\'s for sure. In just 5 years, the average annual volume of the top 10 ports in the world went from 20.34 to 22.40 million TEU (unit of measurement of a container of 20 feet). So, which ports managed to locate in this top 10? It is easy to see that most of the top 10 container ports are located in China (70%) and that the ten are all in Asia. So it is not uncommon to see that freight passes mainly through the South China Sea. This country has become the king of maritime shipments worldwide in the last decade. About two-thirds of the container trade passes through at least one Chinese port or ports that are financed by China. After seeing this ranking, it is not easy to believe that just over 10 years ago, in 2006, only 3 of the top 10 ports in the world were located in China (Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen). This shows how things can change when the market evolves towards new trends. This also applies to other aspects, such as digitization, since those who are really taking advantage will be those who will be leading the market in a short time. That is why all the players in the logistics industry should seek to keep up with the inevitable digital revolution in the industry.', 'afull-projects-news-01.jpg', 0, '2020-01-24 21:50:06'),
